# Hotel Reservation
This is a Java program for a hotel reservation system. It was developed as the first project for the [Java Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079) program at Udacity. It provides reservation services for customers as well as query services for administrative use. 

## Customer scenarios
1. **Creating a customer account**: The customer needs to enter the name and email address. The application will check that the email is in the correct format.
2. **Searching for rooms**: The application searches for available rooms based on the customer's preference and checkin/checkout dates. If no available rooms are found, recommended rooms on alternative dates will be displayed.
3. **Booking a room**
4. **Viewing reservations**
