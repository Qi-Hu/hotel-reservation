# Hotel Reservation
This is a Java program for a hotel reservation system. It was developed as the first project for the [Java Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079) program at Udacity. It provides reservation services for customers as well as query services for administrative use.

3. **Booking a room**
4. **Viewing reservations**
